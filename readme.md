# ReadME Generator

## Description

The purpose of this application is to help developers save time creating README.md files for their various projects and repositories. The program will take the user through a series of command-line prompts to gather details about the project such as title, description, licensing information, contact information, etc. With that userâ€™s input, the program writes a high-quality README.md file which then a user can use or build upon further.
